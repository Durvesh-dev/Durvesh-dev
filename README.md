## 🔧 How to customize quickly
1. Replace placeholders: `DURVESH_EMAIL_HERE`, `LINKEDIN_URL`, `PORTFOLIO_URL`, `RESUME_URL`, and `PROJECT_LINK_*`.  
2. Add screenshots: create a folder `assets/` and add images — reference them with `![screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)` under each project.  
3. Add a short 1-min demo video: upload to YouTube and link to it in the project sections.  
4. Keep the README concise — recruiters scan it in 20–30 seconds. Put the strongest projects / metrics first.

---

### 🎯 Final tips (industry expectations)
- Keep project READMEs consistent: installation, usage, screenshots, tech stack, and a short demo link.  
- Add `LICENSE` (MIT for open source) and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you want outside contributions.  
- Add unit tests or CI badges if you have automated tests — companies value testable code.  
- Keep commit history clean (meaningful commit messages) and maintain branches for features.

---

Thanks — paste that into `Durvesh-dev/README.md` and tell me if you want:
- a version with **badge icons & animations**,  
- **detailed README** for any single project, or  
- a **one-page portfolio website** generated from these details.
